To the brave hero,

i have heard of your plans to bring my master to justice.
My humble self has suffered enough from his forceful hand so I decided
to help you.

You are right to come while the sun is still up.
The master will be in his bedroom on the top floor of the castle.

But beware to find your way to him before sundown or be prepared for a battle...
probaby to your death.

Sincerely, 

a humble servant
