# world_of_zuul__draculas_castle

A console app game based on the famous World Of Zuul game from the BlueJ book for learning Object Oriented Programming in Java.
The idea of this game was to learn and apply various programming techniques including polymorphism and abstraction to create a first
sort of complex program run in the Java console. It's entirely text based so no GUI is involved and by this kind of takes you back
to the early days of computer games.

Anyway feel free to check it out and give me a shout if you have any remarks.
There is only a little doc commenting throughout the code because honestly I had to get it ready in time for the exam ;)
